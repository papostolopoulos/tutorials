## What is a coin?
* A decentralized digital currency. It can be transferred from person to person. It is
not owned by governments and it is not regulated by banks.
* It does not have a tangible format (like paper money or gold)
* It can be divisible up to the eighth decimal place a unit (In money, we divide up to the
  second decimal).
* The symbol is BTC.
* There is only 21 million Bitcoins that are gradually being released. These coins are released
until the year 2140.
* The bitcoin network is very difficult to hack. That is because the network spans across several
computers around the globe. There is no central entity like a bank that can be attacked but it is
rather a cross reference network among several computers.

## Challenges
* The previous crypto currencies had the problem that is called "double spent".
If somebody would spend a unit of the crypto currency, nobody would know that it was spent.
Nobody had the ability to know if a person had the amount of currency they claimed they did,
nor they knew if the currency was spent.

## Advantages and value of bitcoin
* It could provide access to financial services to people that cannot access the traditional
banking services through the traditional financial institutions.
* Fiat currencies are getting inflated by printing more money. When governments are printing
more money they are essentially devaluing the money. That could essentially result into having
money loose all of its value. On the other hand, bitcoin cannot get inflated because there is
always a particular amount of coins that will eventually be created (21M).
* It is decentralized.
* It is limited in numbers of units.
* It is a peer to peer currency exchange system. No governments are involved.
* It can be anonymous.
* It is transparent. The code that the bitcoin is based on is open source and therefore anyone
can go and look at the code.
* It is trusted. It has been examined for over 5 years and therefore the protocol is trusted.
* It has low transaction fees.
* It is irreversible.
* It is not backed by anything tangible (like paper money).
* It gets its value by what people are willing to pay for it. Therefore its value fluctuates
according to the people's perception of what this currency should be valued over time.
* Also people value the bitcoin because:
** There is no government control. The governments cannot manipulate the currency but it is
solely valued by the people trading it.
** There is protection of the currency from inflation.
** The currency's protocol is trusted.

## What is money and how it is defined
* Money is the means we use to exchange goods and services.
* The most prevalent ways to exchange goods and services in history have been the typical currency
(like dollars) or gold.
* There are four properties that money has:
** It needs to be divisible (broken into smaller pieces)
** It needs to be durable, stand the pressure of time.
** It needs to be fungible like a commodity. That means for example that a dollar is equally valued
to another dollar.
** It needs to be verifiable.

## How does bitcoin work?
* The bitcoin is stored in a public ledger (λογιστικό βιβλίο).
*  Sending and receiving coins is an easy process.
* Coins can be stored in different types of wallets. These wallets can be:
** A local hard drive
** A portable hard drive (stick)
** Hosted online
** Write the codes associated to the coins on pieces of paper

## Account for having Bitcoins
* A public key which is similar to an account number / address
* It is constituted by 27 - 34 alphanumeric characters.
* A private key which serves as the password to access the bitcoins in an account.
Note: the bitcoins are still in the public ledger but they belong to the person that is
behind the public and the private key.

# How can someone get Bitcoins
* Buy from a person or an exchange service
* Barter (offer products or services).
* Mine bitcoins (run a specific software to find bitcoins). This depends of the computer
capacity someone has. The bigger the capacity of the computer, the better the chance that
bitcoins will be mined
