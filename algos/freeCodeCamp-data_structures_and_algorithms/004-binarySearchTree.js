/*
A binary search tree is constituted by nodes.
Each node can have up to two branches.
Left branch has a value that is lesser or equal to the parent node while the
right node can have a value that is larger or equal to the parent node. 
That results in the binary search tree to have an ordered structure.
In a binary search tree, on average half of the search operations can be skipped.
So addition, deletion or search is proportional to the logarithm of the number of
nodes that constitute the binary search tree.
This is better than the linear order of an array where we have to investigate each
element separately.
