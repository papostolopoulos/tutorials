  <h1>9 - Components Basics</h1>
  <div id="componentBasics1">
    <h2>Components are reusable</h2>
    <p>
      Components are reusable Vue instances with a name.
    </p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>
        In the following example, two different buttons are created. They both feed
        from the same component. The data in the components do not conflict with one
        another since the component is reusable and therefore it represents a different
        Vue instance.
      </p>
      <button-counter></button-counter> <br>
      <button-counter></button-counter>
      <code>
Vue.component(&quot;button-counter&quot;, {
  data() {
    return {
      counter: 0
    }
  },
  template: &quot;&lt;button v-on:click=&apos;counter++&apos;&gt;I was clicked { {counter} } times&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
});
      </code>
    </div>
    <h2>Components characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the components are reusable Vue instances. Same like all
      the instances, they accept the same properties like the <code>new Vue();</code>
      instance. Therefore, the components can have <code>data</code>, <code>methods</code>,
      <code>watch</code>, <code>computed</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the components do not need an <code>el</code> property.
    </p>
    <h3><code>data</code> should be a function</h3>
    <p>
      Contrary to the <code>new Vue</code> instance, the <code>data</code> property
      in the components should always be a function. That is because the components
      are reusable and therefore, the function is needed to return an independent copy
      of the <code>data</code> object.
    </p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>
        As you see in the following example, when clicking one of the buttons, both
        of them have their value updated. That is because they are both feeding from
        the same <code>data</code> property in the <code>new Vue</code> instance.
        So contrary to the example above where the <code>Vue.component</code> allows
        for the <code>data</code> properties values to be different (through the
        returned function), the <code>new Vue</code> instance is feeding both of
        the buttons from only one <code>data</code> property and therefore the
        value rendered for both buttons is the same.
      </p>
      <button v-on:click="counter++">You clicked me {{counter}} times</button>
      <button v-on:click="counter++">You clicked me {{counter}} times</button>
      <code>
&lt;button v-on:click=&apos;counter++&apos;&gt;You clicked me {{counter}} times&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button v-on:click=&apos;counter++&apos;&gt;You clicked me {{counter}} times&lt;/button&gt;
      </code>
    </div>
</div>

<script>
  Vue.component("button-counter", {
    data() {
      return {
        counter: 0
      }
    },
    template: "<button v-on:click='counter++'>You clicked me {{counter}} times</button>"
  });


  var componentBasics1 = new Vue({
    el: "#componentBasics1",
    data: {
      counter: 0
    }
  });
</script>




<div id="componentBasics2">
  <h2>Organizing components</h2>
  <p>
    The components can be
    used in a tree format to represent different parts of the web page like the
    heading of the page, the nav tag, different sections, differentm articles, the
    footer et cetera.
  </p>
  <p>
    Components can either be organized locally or globally. Globaly registered
    components (<code>Vue.component</code>) can be used by the root Vue instance,
    which is <b>created afterwards</b>. Also the components can be used inside all
    the sub-components of the Vue instance's component tree.
  </p>


  <h2>Passing data to child components with props</h2>
  <p>
    Props are custom attributes that can be passed to a component. For example,
    same like in an <code>input</code> tag we have attributes like <code>type</code>
    or <code>name</code>, we can create custom attributes to the Vue component in
    order to bind different types of data that come from the root Vue instance
    (<code>new Vue</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    When a value is passed into the prop attribute, it becomes a property of that
    component instance. As mentioned in the above paragraph, we can pass different
    props values (in the format of an array) who in their turn can pull different
    data from the root Vue istance.
  </p>

</div>


<script>
  var componentBasics2 = new Vue({
    el: "#componentBasics2",
    data: {
      history: [
        {id: 1, title: "Battle of Marathon", fact: "The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC, during the first Persian invasion of Greece. It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece."},
        {id: 1, title: "Battle of Thermopylae", fact: "The Battle of Thermopylae was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by King Leonidas of Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I over the course of three days, during the second Persian invasion of Greece."},
        {id: 1, title: "Battle of Plataea", fact: "The Battle of Plataea was the final land battle during the second Persian invasion of Greece. It took place in 479 BC near the city of Plataea in Boeotia, and was fought between an alliance of the Greek city-states, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I."},
        {id: 1, title: "Battle of Salamis", fact: "The Battle of Salamis was a naval battle fought between an alliance of Greek city-states under Themistocles and the Persian Empire under King Xerxes in 480 BC which resulted in a decisive victory for the outnumbered Greeks."},
      ]
    }
  });
