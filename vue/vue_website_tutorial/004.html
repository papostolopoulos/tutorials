  <h1>004 - Computed Properties and Watchers</h1>

  <div id="computedProperties1">
    <h2>Computed properties</h2>
    <p>The in-template expressions are useful for relatively simple operations but
    can be bloated in size if the application we are building tends to be more complex.</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <div id="example">
  {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}
</div>

    </div>

    <p>Computed properties are useful when we want to use complex logics that are
      probably going to be frequently repeated. In-template expressions
    ({{somethingHere}}) should be simple.</p>



    <p>Original message: "{{message}}"</p>
    <p>"Computed" reversed message - 	&#123; &#123;reversedMessage	&#125; &#125;: "{{reversedMessage}}"</p>
    <p>"Methods" reversed message - 	&#123; &#123;reverseMessage()&#125; &#125;: "{{reverseMessage()}}"</p>
    <p>Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method instead.
      For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. <br>
      However, the difference is that computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. <br>
      A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its dependencies have changed. <br>
      This means as long as message has not changed, multiple access to the reversedMessage computed property will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the function again.<br>
    In comparison, a method invocation will <b>always</b> run the function whenever a re-render happens.<br>
  </p>

  <h4>Why do we need caching?</h4>
  <p> Imagine we have an expensive computed property A, which requires looping through a huge Array and doing a lot of computations.<br>
    Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on A. Without caching, we would be executing A’s getter many more times than necessary! <br>
    In cases where you do not want caching, use a method instead.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="watch-example">
    <h3>Watchers</h3>
    <p>While computed properties are more appropriate in most cases, there are times when a custom watcher is necessary.<br>
      That’s why Vue provides a more generic way to react to data changes through the watch option. <br>
      This is most useful when you want to perform asynchronous or expensive operations in response to changing data.</p>

      <p>Ask a yes or no question
      <input v-model="question">
      </p>

      <p>In this case, using the watch option allows us to perform an asynchronous operation (accessing an API), limit how often we perform that operation, <br>
        and set intermediary states until we get a final answer. None of that would be possible with a computed property.</p>
      <p>{{answer}}</p>
