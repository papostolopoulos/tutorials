  <h1>Learn and understand node.js - Tony Alicea</h1>

  <h2>Lecture 4: The command line interface</h2>

  <h3>Big word: Command Line Interface</h3>
  <p>A utility to type commands to your computer rather than clicking</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bash on Linux</li>
    <li>Terminal on Mac</li>
    <li>Command Prompt on Windows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Big word: Arguments</h3>
  <p>Arguments are values you give to your program that affect how it runs. <br>
  Essentially passing paramenters to a function</p>



  <h2>Lecture 6: Processors, Machine language and C++ (V8 JavaScript engine)</h2>

  <h3>Big word: Machine code (or Machine language)</h3>
  <p>Programming languages spoken by computer processors. <br>
  Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code</p>
  <p></p>



  <h2>Lecture 7: JavaScript Engines and the ECMAScript Specification</h2>
  <h3>Big word: ECMAScript</h3>
  <p>The standard JavaScript is based on. How the language should work.<br>
  ECMAScript is needed a standard since there are many engines, other than V8</p>

  <h3>Big word: Javascript Engine</h3>
  <p>A program that converts Javascript code nto something the computer processor can understand. <br>
  And it should follow the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and what features it should have.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 8: V8 under the hood</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 9: Adding features to JavaScript</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 10: Servers and Clients</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 11: What does Javascript need to manage a server</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces</li>
    <li>Ways to deal with files</li>
    <li>Ways to deal with databases</li>
    <li>The ability to communicate over the Internet</li>
    <li>The ability to accept requests and send responses (in the standard format)</li>
    <li>A way to deal with work that takes too long</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Lecture 12: The C++ core</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 13: the Javascript Core</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 14: Downloading Lecture Source Code</h2>



  <h2>Lecture 15: let's install and run some Javascript in Node</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Break point</h3>
  <p>A spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code. <br>
  So we can figure out what's going on...</p>



  <h2>Lecture 16: Modules</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Module</h3>
  <p>A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code. <br>
  Javascript did not have this before.</p>

  <h3>Big word: CommonJS modules</h3>
  <p>An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 17: First-Class functions and function expressions</h2>
  <h3>Big word: First class functions</h3>
  <p>Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions. <br>
  You can use functions like strings, numbers, etc. (i.e. pass them around,
  set variables equal to them, put them in arrays, and more).</p>

  <h3>Big word: Expression</h3>
  <p>A block of code that results in a value <br>
  Function expressions are possible in Javascript because functions are first class.</p>

  <h3>Big word: Invoke</h3>
  <p>It means run the function. <br>
  We also say "call" the function.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 18: Let's build a module</h2>



  <h2>Lecture 19: Objects and object literals</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Name/Value pair</h3>
  <p>The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given <b>context</b>.<br>
    That value may be more name/value pairs. <br>
    (you also know them as key / value pair or properties of objects)</p>

  <h3>Big word: Object: A collection of name/value pairs</h3>
  <p>The simplest definition when talking about JavaScript.</p>

  <h3>Big word: Object literal</h3>
  <p>name/value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces</p>



  <h2>Lecture 20: Prototypal inheritance and Function Constructors</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Inheritance</h3>
  <p>One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object</p>
  <h3>Big word: Function constructors</h3>
  <p>A normal function that is used to construct objects. <br>
  The "this" variable points a new empty object, and that object is returned
  from the function automatically.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 21: By reference and by value</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Primitive</h3>
  <p>A type of data that represents a single value. <br>
  For example, a number or a string. In other words, not an object.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 22: Immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Scope</h3>
  <p>Where in code you have access to particular variable or function</p>



  <h2>Lecture 23: How do node modules really work?: Module.exports and require</h2>



  <h2>Lecture 24: JSON</h2>
  <h3>Big word: JSON - Javascript Object Notation</h3>
  <p>A standard for structuring data that is inspired by Javascript Object Literals. <br>
  Javascript engines are built to understand it.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 25: More on require</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 26: Module patterns</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Revealing module pattern</h3>
  <p>Exposing only the properties and methods you want via a returned object. <br>
  A very common and clean way to structure and protect code within modules.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 27: Exports vs module.exports</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Mutate</h3>
  <p>To change something <br>
  For example, adding a method or property to an object means you've mutated the object.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 28: Requiring Native (Core) modules</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 29: Modules and ES6</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 30: Web server checklist</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 31: Events and the event emitter</h2>
  <h3>Lecture 32: Event</h3>
  <p>Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to. <br>
  In Node we actually talk about two different kinds of events.</p>



   <h2>Lecture 33: Object properties, first class functions and arrays</h2>
   <h2>Lecture 34: The Node event emitter Part 1</h2>
   <h3>Big word: Event Listener</h3>
   <p>The code that responds to an event.<br>
   In Javascript's case, the listerer will be a function.</p>



   <h2>Lecture 34: The Node event emitter Part 2</h2>
   <h3>Magic string</h3>
   <p>A string that has a special meaning on our code<br>
   This is bad because it makes it easy for a typo to cause a bug, and hard for tools to help us find it.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 35: Object.create and prototypes</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 36: Inheriting from the event emitter. Part 1</h2>



    <h2>Lecture 37: Node, ES6 and template literals</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Template literal</h3>
    <p>A way to concatenate strings in Javascript (ES6)<br>
    Easier to work with than a bunch of strings concatenated with '+'</p>



    <h2>Lecture 38: .call and .apply</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 39: Inheriting from the event emitter. Part 2</h2>



    <h2>Lecture 40: ES6 Classes</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Syntactic sugar</h3>
    <p>A feature that only changes how you type something, but nothing changes under the hood.<br>
    It is important to understand what is happening under the hood, so we dont't make decisions based on flawed assumptions.</p>




    <h2>Lecture 41: Inheriting from the event emitter = Part 3</h2>



    <h1>Section 6: Asynchronous code, libuv, the event loop, streams, files and more...</h1>
    <h2>Lecture 42: Javascript is synchronous</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Asynchronous</h3>
    <p>More than one process running simultaneously <br>
    Node does things asynchronously. V8 does not.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Synchronous</h3>
    <p>One process executing at a time.<br>
    Javascript is synchronous. Only one line of code executing at a time. NodeJS is Asynchronous</p>



    <h2>Lecture 43: Callbacks</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Callbacks</h3>
    <p>A function that is passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.<br>
    The function 'calls back' invoking the function you give it when it is done doing its work.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 44: libuv, The Event Loop, and Non-Blocking Asynchronous code</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Non-blocking</h3>
    <p>Doing other things without stopping your programming from running.<br>
    This is made possible by Node's doing things asynchronously.</p>




    <h2>Lecture 45: Streams and buffers</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Buffer</h3>
    <p>A temporary holding spot for data being moved from one place to another.<br>
    Intentionally limited in size.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Stream</h3>
    <p>A sequence of data made available over time.<br>
    Pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 46: Binary data, character sets, and encoding</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Binary Data</h3>
    <p>Data stored in binary (sets of 1s and 0s).<br>
    The core of the math that computers are based on. Each one or zero is called a 'bit' or 'binary digit'.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Character set</h3>
    <p>A representation of characters as numbers.<br>
    Each character gets a number. Unicode and ASCII are character sets.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Character encoding</h3>
    <p>How characters are stored in binary.<br>
    The numbers (or code points) are converted and stored in binary.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 47: Buffers</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 48: ES6 Typed Arrays</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Byte</h3>
    <p>8 bits. (8 zeroes and ones)<br>
    01100101</p>



    <h2>Lecture 49: Callbacks</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 50: Files and files</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Error-first callback</h3>
    <p>Callbacks thake an error object as their first parameter.<br>
    null if no error, otherwise will contain an object defininf the error. This is a standard so we know in what
    order to place ourparamenters for our callbacks.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 51: Streams</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Chunk</h3>
    <p>A piece of data being sent through a stream.<br>
    Data os split in "chunks"and streamed.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Abstract (Base) class</h3>
    <p>A type of constructor you never work directly with, but inherit from.<br>
    We create new custom objects which inherit from the abstract base class.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 52: Conseptual aside - Pipes</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Pipe</h3>
    <p>Connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.<br>
    In Node you pipe from a readable stream to a writable stream.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 53: Pipes</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Method Chaining</h3>
    <p>A method returns an object so we can keep calling more methods.<br>
    Sometimes it returns the parent object (called 'cascading') and sometimes some other object.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Better ways to organize our code. <br>
      Using modules</li>

      <li>A way to deal with work that takes a long time <br>
      Keep the V8 engine running while other tasks are running in Node.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Section 7: HTTP and being a Web Server</h1>
    <h2>Lecture 55: TCP/IP</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Protocol</h3>
    <p>A set of rules two sides agree on to use when communicating.<br>
    Both the client and server are programmed to understand and use that particular set of rules. 
    It's similar to two people from different countries agreeing on a language to speak in.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 56: Addresses and Ports</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Port</h3>
    <p>Once a computer receives a packet, how it knows what program to send it to.<br>
    When a program is setup on the operating system to receive packets from a particular port,
    it is said that the program is 'listening; to that port.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 57: HTTP</h2>
    <h3>Big word: HTTP</h3>
    <p>A set of rules (and a format) for data being transferred on the web.<br>
    Stands for 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol'. It's a format (of various)
    defining data being transfrerred via TCP/IP</p>
    <h3>Big word: MIME type</h3>
    <p>A standard for specifying the type of data being sent.<br>
    Stands for 'Multipurpose Internet Main Extensions'. Examples: 
    application/json, text/html, image/jpeg.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 58: http_parser</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 59: Let's build a server in Node</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 60: Outputting HTML and templates</h2>
    <h3>Big word: template</h3>
    <p>Text designed to be the basis for final text or content after being processed.<br>
    There's usually some specific template language, so the template system knows how to replace placeholders with real values.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 61: Streams and performance</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 62: APIs and Endpoints</h2>
    <h3>Big word: API</h3>
    <p>A set of tools for building a software application.<br>
    Stands for "Application Programming Interface". On the web, the tools are usually made available via a set of URLs which accept
    and send only data via HTTP and TCP/IP.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Endpoint</h3>
    <p>One URL in a web API.<br>
    Sometimes that endpoint (URL) does multiple things by making choices based on the HTTP request headers.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 63: Outputting JSON</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Serialize</h3>
    <p>Translating an object into a format that can be stored or transferred.<br>
    JSON, CSV, XML, and others are popular. 'Deserialize' is the opposite (converting the format back into an object).</p>



    <h2>Lecture 64: Routing</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Routing</h3>
    <p>Mapping HTTP requests to content.<br>
    Whether actual files that exist on the server, or not.</p>

    <h2>Lecture 66: Packages and Package Managers</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Package</h3>
    <p>A collection of code.<br>
    It is managed and maintained with a package management system.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Package Management System</h3>
    <p>Software that automates installing and updating packages.<br>
    Deals with what version you have or need, and manages <b>dependencies</b>.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Dependency</h3>
    <p>Code that another set of code depends on to function.<br>
    If you use that code in your app, it is a dependency. Your app depends on it.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 67: Conceptual Aside: Semantic Versioning (semver)</h2>
    <h3>Big word: versioning</h3>
    <p>Specifying what version of a set of code this is...<br>
    ...so others can track if a new version has come out. This allows to watch for new features, or to watch for 'breaking changes'.<br>
    The word 'semantic' implies that something conveys meaning.</p>


    <h2>Lecture 68: npm and the npm registry: Other People's Code</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 69: init, nodemon, and package.json</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 70: That was just documentation online.</h2>

    <h1>Express</h1>
    <h2>Lecture 73: Installing Express and making it easier to build a web Server</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Environment variables</h3>
    <p>Global variables specific to the environment (server) our code is living in.<br>
    Different servers can have different variable settings, and we can access those values in code.</p>
    <h3>Big word: HTTP method</h3>
    <p>specifies the type of action the request wishes to make.<br>
    GET, POST, DELETE and others. Also called <b>verbs</b>.</p>

    <h2>Lecture 74: Routes</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 75: Static files and middleware</h2>
    <h3>Big word: Middleware</h3>
    <p>Code that sits between two layers of software.<br>
    In the case of Express, sitting between the request and the response.</p>
    <h3>Big word: Static</h3>
    <p>Not dynamic.<br>
    In other words, not processed by code in any way. For example, HTML, CSS and image files are 'static' files.</p>



    <h2>Lecture 76: Templates and template engines</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 77: Querystring and Post Parameters</h2>
    <h2>Lecture 78: RESTful APIs and JSON</h2>
    <h3>Big word: REST</h3>
    <p>An architectural style for building APIs<br>
    Stands for 'Representational State Transfrer'. We decide that HTTP verbs and URLs mean something.</p>
