##Video 1 - Introduction and workspace setup
* [] Started building on top of the existing video he created for the webpack tutorial and did extra changes on the file
* [] Installed babel for transpiling the react code so JSX and ES6 code. 1.25
* [] Added loaders in the webpack.config.js file. everything that is a .js file runs through the babel loader and they are going to transpile react and es2015 (presents) to plugings.
* [] In the same file, entry is client.js and output is client.min.js where the code is transpiled.
* [] In client.js, he has import react from "react" and import reactDom from react-dom which is the rendering engine. So react does not render directly to html but it is separate from the rendering process.
* [] Installed webpack-dev-server with extra information. Then he added the command to the package json. in the scripts key he added the dev:value pair.
* [] then he uninstalled the dev-server globally and he can run the app with npm run dev because it is installed locally and it references the executable file in the node_modules directory
